This file represents the set of useful presentation ideas.

A first set of useful points
- service replication
- desired state reconciliation
- cluster state replication
- raft
- mesh networking
- gossip protocol

A second (more elaborate) set of useful points
- start by talking about how replication is the most fundamental way you can start with high availability
- and then go into how you can use desired state reconciliation to maintain your replication
- and then talk about how you replicate cluster state so that your desired state engine is also HA
- and then explain how raft ensures that your replicated cluster is consistent
- and then switch gears and talk a bit about networking.
